# 🌍 Disaster Aid Tracker

A decentralized Web3 platform to transparently track donations for disaster relief efforts using Ethereum smart contracts.

## 🚀 Overview

In times of crisis — floods, earthquakes, or pandemics — transparent allocation of aid funds is critical. This DApp allows donors to contribute directly to causes, track where their funds go, and ensure all donations are logged publicly on the Ethereum blockchain.
